### Skills

2. Think broadly. An excellent Mentor should have a broad vision, be able to think about issues from multiple angles, and give constructive advice. Don't limit yourself to your own experience, but be able to think about problems from the perspective of students or employees.
3. Good communication skills. Mentors should be good at listening, be able to express their ideas clearly, and establish good communication with students or employees. Also be able to guide others clearly and patiently.
4. Strong sense of responsibility. We must take every student or employee seriously, and provide guidance and feedback persistently, rather than perfunctorily.
5. Be willing to share. An excellent Mentor will not have a conservative mentality, but is willing to share his knowledge and experience with students or employees, so that the other party can be improved to the greatest extent.
6. Have empathy. Be able to stand in the perspective of students or employees and understand their ideas instead of imposing your own opinions.
